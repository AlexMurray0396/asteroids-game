# asteroids-game

A boot.dev mini project designed to learn how to interact with and write object-oriented code.

# How to play

Initialise the game with `uv run main.py`. 

The player is controlled with the W-A-S-D keys and can shoot using the space bar.

Avoid being hit by asteroids. Collisions will kill the player and close the game.

Shoot asteroids to destroy them, but be careful - large asteroids will break into 2 smaller asteroids when destroyed.

# To do:

Implement scoring system.
